# Detecting-Glaucoma-with-ML

This is my senior year research project at [Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology's](https://tjhsst.fcps.edu/) Computer Systems Research Laboratory. I conducted research from August 2020 to May 2021. The project was supervised by Dr. John Zacharias. 

For this project, I designed and developed software that detects glaucoma, an eye disease, from retinal fundus images. I trained machine learning models on large image datasets and conducted classification analysis. 

Here is my [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nZiOIuubsjpSxYoVfDXcSMFEaiVSPAwAgBnEO41rKNI/edit?usp=sharing) for tjSTAR, a regional research symposium, that details my findings.
